Summarize the analysis:

Students enrolled at Charter schools are the top formers compared to those enrolled in District schools. The data that supports this is the dataset that sorts the top 5 and bottom 5. 


Draw two conclusions or comparisons from the calculations:

Higher spending per student does not have any effect on the performance of the students. For example, Huang High School has a 53% overall passing, it is categorized as District, and falls in the bottom 5 schools for Overall Passing, but has a large student population and large spending per student. 
Schools with a larger student population are lower performers. The average math, reading, and percentage of passing math, reading, and overall is much lower than schools with a small to medium class size. A majority of these schools are District, which fall in the bottom 5 performers.
